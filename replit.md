1. **Instant Payment Notifications**
   - Users now receive instant WhatsApp notifications when payment succeeds
   - Notifications include recipient number, MPesa code, and order details
   - Failure notifications with clear reasons (insufficient balance, wrong PIN, etc.)
   - Timeout notifications when payment confirmation takes too long

2. **Manual Client Restart Feature**
   - Admin panel now has "ðŸ”„ Restart" button for each client

   - Supports text messages and images via URL
   - Image URLs are automatically downloaded and sent as WhatsApp media
   - Messages sent to all unique phone numbers from client's orders
   - Progress tracking shows success/failed message counts

4. **Session Persistence**
   - WhatsApp sessions persist across server restarts
   - Auto-initialization of saved clients on startup
   - Staggered initialization (3s apart) to prevent resource contention
   - Keep-alive mechanism runs every 5 minutes checking client status
   - Self-ping every 25 minutes to prevent dyno sleeping

5. **Unlimited Client Support**
   - Uses Map data structure for efficient client management
   - Each client stored in persistent JSON (data/clients.json)
   - Clients automatically reload and reconnect on server restart
   - No limit on number of concurrent WhatsApp bot instances

### Multi-Client Architecture
- Unlimited WhatsApp connections supported
- Each client has independent settings and API credentials
- Clients persist across restarts and auto-reconnect
- Staggered initialization prevents resource overload

### Keep-Alive System
- Checks all clients every 5 minutes
- Auto-reconnects disconnected clients
- Self-ping every 25 minutes to prevent sleeping
- Graceful shutdown saves all client states

## Deployment Notes

### Replit Advantages
- âœ… System dependencies easily installed via Nix
- âœ… Persistent storage for sessions and data
- âœ… Auto-restart on code changes
- âœ… Built-in secrets management
- âœ… Easy HTTPS with custom domain support

### Production Recommendations
- Set strong ADMIN_UI_TOKEN in secrets
- Configure proper admin WhatsApp numbers
- Add Shadow Pay and Statum API credentials
- Monitor health endpoint: `/health`
- Keep at least one active client connected

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Map for Clients?
- O(1) lookups by client ID
- Dynamic client addition/removal
- Memory efficient for unlimited clients

### Why JSON File Storage?
- Simple persistence without database overhead
- Easy backup and migration
- Human-readable for debugging
- Sufficient for moderate order volumes

### Why Staggered Initialization?
- Prevents simultaneous Chromium browser launches
- Reduces CPU/memory spikes on startup
- Ensures stable auto-reconnection

## Developer Notes
